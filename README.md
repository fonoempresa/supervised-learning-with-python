Researchers believe the best way to attack AI is to have strong base in algorithms that mimic what the human brain learns.

### What is machine learning?

### Unsupervised learning

The data taken here neither has proper coordinates nor proper parameters. There is no proper specification of different types of output.

### Reinforcement learning

### Supervised learning

Applied in pursuit of right answer.

Regression : Evaluation of continuous data.

Classification : Data gives out discrete values as output.

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - The Iris Dataset.
