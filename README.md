Researchers believe the best way to attack AI is to have strong base in algorithms that mimic what the human brain learns.

### What is machine learning?

### Unsupervised learning

The data taken here neither has proper coordinates nor proper parameters. There is no proper specification of different types of output.

### Reinforcement learning

### Supervised learning

Applied in pursuit of right answer.

Regression : Evaluation of continuous data.

Classification : Data gives out discrete values as output.

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - The Iris Dataset.

**Features:**

● Petal length

● Petal width

● Sepal length

● Sepal width

Target variable: Species

● Versicolor

● Virginica

● Setosa

### **Using KNN for classification.**

The KNN(K- Nearest Neighbors ) algorithm can be summarized as:

A positive integer k is specified, along with a new sample.

We select the k entries in our database which are closest to the new sample.

We find the most common classification of these entries.

This is the classification we give to the new sample.
