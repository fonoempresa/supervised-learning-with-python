### **Using KNN for classification.**

The KNN(K- Nearest Neighbors ) algorithm can be summarized as:

A positive integer k is specified, along with a new sample.

We select the k entries in our database which are closest to the new sample.

We find the most common classification of these entries.

This is the classification we give to the new sample.
